# da25-git

I have approached my brief from a more rhetoric aspect. Analyzing words, or the lack of them as the other aspect.
I have built a pipeline where I've downloaded a file from Kaggle, cleaned those columns that was needed to answer the questions, 
and then uploaded the transformed data to Snowflake.

Note to the reader: Python offers several powerful libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) that could be used for further data cleaning. 
Exploring this area too can be done when there's more time.
